# arduino-degausser
The degausser applies a decreasing alternating magnetic field. The decreasing field is produced by TRIAC phase control.

Why I made this device:   When milling, the parallel blocks or the vice jaws can become magnetic. Milling chips stick to them and are difficult to remove. This demagnetizer applies a decreasing alternating magnetic field.
